                Boarding Students
                Boarding students are not permitted to have vehicles (other than bicycles) on campus. Under this policy vehicles include, but are not limited to; cars, motorcycles, electric bicycles, gas powered bicycles, etc. Unauthorized vehicles will be towed off campus or stored in an onsite facility if possible until they can be returned home. Cars will be taken to a compound in the local area. The cost of the tow and impound will be borne by the parents. For safety reasons, the school strongly discourages boarding students from keeping cars in the Lakefield area.

                Day Students
                Day students must register their cars (make and license number) with their Day Head of House. At which point they will be given a parking tag to hang off of their car’s rear-view mirror. For security reasons, this tag must be present and visible at all times. If the tag is not visible, the school reserves the right to tow the vehicle at the owner’s expense. The following guidelines must also be adhered to:

                • Day students who drive to school must park their cars in the lot by the maintenance buildings.

                • Cars are NOT to be used for any purpose other than coming to school and departing from school at the end of the day. Cars may not be used during the school day unless specific permission is granted by the Head of House each time a student wishes to use their vehicle. Parents must also grant permission each time the student wishes to use their car during the day.

                • Cars may not be driven to any residence on campus or to the waterfront at any time, for any reason.

                • Cars are not to be used to go to school-sanctioned events (including sports) where bus transportation has been organized unless the student is going directly home after the event. In such instances, the student may not transport other students in their car.

                • Day students may only transport other day students in their car who are noted at the bottom of the car policy form (located on the eRegistration system). Boarding students must have permission from their parents and must check with their Head of House each time they are passengers in a vehicle.

                • Students must adhere to the 20 km/h speed limit on campus and must practice safe and responsible driving behaviour at all times.

                • The car policy form must be completed and filed with the assigned Day Head of House

                • Students are to return the parking tag at the end of the school year. Students who lose their parking tag will be charged a replacement fee of $5.00.

                Contravention of the Car Policy

                Day students who contravene the car policy will be held accountable in the following manner:
                • 1st Offence: 1-week suspension of car privileges (car not permitted on campus for 7 days)

                • 2nd Offence: 1-month suspension of car privileges (car not permitted on campus for 30 days)

                • Subsequent Offences: Student will be required to attend a meeting of the Standards Committee for Persistent Inability to Abide by the Expectations of the School. Student will have their car privileges revoked for an indefinite period of time greater than 30 days and will be placed on Directed Probation for Persistent Inability to Abide by the Expectations of the School. Students will be liable for suspension from the school

                Taxis
                For personal use, taxis must be paid for directly by the student. The high cost of taxis in the Lakefield area usually prompts students to share cabs into Peterborough. For medical appointments, the nursing staff will distribute taxi charging slips. Taxi slips will also be given to students for other school-sanctioned events or co-curricular functions.

Day students and day student parents will be regularly emailed a bus schedule. Since Lakefield College School is unable to provide a bus monitor for the Day Student buses that drive to and from the school each day, we require all students using the Day Student Bus to abide by the following Code of Conduct at all times.

                            • Harassment of other students in any form will not be tolerated.

                            • The bus is simply an extension of the school. Behaviour that would not be tolerated in the classroom or in the halls at LCS is not permitted on the bus.

                            • If, in the opinion of the driver, there is behaviour that distracts the driver from his or her job and compromises the safe operation of the bus, the driver will immediately warn the student(s). The incident will be documented and any similar incidents, whether immediately following the one in question or at any time in the future, with any driver, will seriously jeopardize the student’s bus riding privileges.

                            • Abuse of bus property or the property of other students will not be tolerated.

                            • The bus is considered a “Nut Free Area.” No food items containing nuts or nut products are allowed on the bus.

                            • Garbage should be removed from the bus or deposited in the appropriate receptacle at the front of the bus.

                            • Everyone is to remain seated while the bus is in motion.

                            • Students are to keep their feet out of the aisle. No equipment or personal belongings are to be in the aisle while the bus is in motion.

                            • Potentially dangerous sports equipment, such as skates or skis, must be enclosed in a proper equipment bag.

                            • Priority goes to filling seats with students, to a maximum of two people per seat. If room permits, students will be able to bring large equipment bags which must be placed on seats at the front of the bus.

                            • Personal bags are to remain on the lap of each student or at their feet.

                            • Seating is a “first-come, first-served” system. There is no implicit or explicit seating order or hierarchy on the bus at any time. Students are not expected to move from the seat they occupy.
                              Students riding the bus to LCS or home from LCS must abide by the Code of Conduct presented here. If a student is unable to control their actions and shows by their actions that they cannot follow this Code of Conduct, they will not be permitted to ride the bus. Depending on the degree of the infraction, a student’s eligibility to use the busing service may be suspended for a brief period of time, or could be removed entirely. Students may also be liable to attend a meeting of the Standards Committee for serious behavioural infractions that occur while using the bus.

Students must ask their Head of House for weekend leave before 10:00 p.m. Thursday before the weekend they intend to leave (Associate Faculty are not able to grant permission for weekend leave). The student will do this by email, cc’ing their parents, the intended hosts and their Head of House.

                            2. The Head of House will contact the student’s parents on or before the Friday of the weekend leave and discourage missing class time. If the leave is necessary, the Head of House will confirm departure and return times with the parents.

                            3. The Head of House will put a planned absence into the student’s Edsby attendance record.

                            4. Students who miss class are responsible for any of the work they have missed and are expected to return to campus between 8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. on Sunday.

Students in Grade 12, with parent approval, sign a medication contract and are responsible for their own medication. Failure to take the medication as prescribed will result in cancellation of the medication contract. At that point, all medication will be administered through the Health and Well-being Centre. Common sense dictates that some medication (i.e. inhalers for the treatment of asthma, etc.) do not fall into this category.

Documentation of missed medication will be kept by the Health and Well-being Centre.
                        
                        • Should missed medication appear to be a pattern of non-compliant behaviour or abuse of medication, the Director of Health and Well-being will inform the Assistant Heads by email. An Assistant Head will contact the Head of House and the Advisor. The parent(s) of the student will be contacted by the Director of Health and Well-being to explain our policy and concerns. Should the student miss subsequent medications, the school may require him/her to go home on a medical leave of absence as the school can no longer be responsible for the well-being of the student. The Director of Health and Well-being will communicate the above to the parents with copies to the Head of House and the Health and Well-being Centre.

Any option or strategy that strays from school policy and is agreeable to all parties must be written and signed by the parents, the student and the school, with copies given to the parents, the student, the Head of House and the Health and Well-being Centre.

Such notification will be recorded in the student’s Ontario Student Record (OSR) for future reference. In such instances, a student would be required to be at home in the care of his or her parents until the Friday of Closing events.

                        Lakefield College School is a community guided by the principles of trust, respect, spirit and participation. In order for the school to achieve its goal of graduating well-rounded young adults, each student must strive to fulfill these fundamental ideals by accepting and exemplifying, in attitude and action, the values of the community.

                        Trust and respect require that each student possesses a caring attitude for fellow students and staff as well as for the school and its traditions. Appreciating the rights and dignity of all of the people who are members of this community is an essential part of the growth of a Lakefield College School student.

                        Students should make every effort to display spirit and pride for the school. This is accomplished by enthusiastically supporting the endeavours of peers and making a personal commitment to the pursuit of excellence. Academic honesty, sportsmanship and adherence to school standards fosters pride in individual and school accomplishments.

                        In order to receive the most from a Lakefield College School education, students must demonstrate a commitment to immerse themselves fully in the community by participating in the myriad of activities offered here. Participation also includes fulfillment of the school motto to promote wellness in each student, in mind, body and spirit.

                        The Grove is and will only be, as strong as the students who make up the community. Therefore, it is essential that each individual student be willing to make the following commitment to the values of Lakefield: I support the principles of trust, respect, spirit and participation. I will do my best to leave Lakefield College School a better place than when I arrived. Acknowledgements: Tim Syrett, Heather Patterson, Andrew Johnston — Class of ’95


                        Expectations of a Grove Student
                        • The school expects its students to uphold its values and expectations, to abide by its behavioural policies and to understand that any conduct bringing disrespect to the school or involving the student with the law, including serious instances occurring out of term time, may cause the student to be liable for school suspension or expulsion.

                        • The school expects parents/guardians to be supportive of the school’s policies and encourages parental involvement at all levels.

                        • Continued refusal to uphold school policies will jeopardize the student’s future at the school.

                                    Grove Senior Status applies to all students currently in their Grade 11 year at LCS. It provides senior students with an opportunity to experience more senior-type privileges as a result of demonstrated positive behaviours and attitudes. Grove Senior Status privileges are a reinforcement/ acknowledgement of the following values/behaviours/attitudes: self-discipline, self-control, student’s willingness to follow House/LCS routines and expectations and demonstration of good citizenship within the school community.

                                    Grove Senior Status can begin after a sequence of meetings (Grade 11 team meeting and Head of House meeting) have taken place. The process of reviewing Grove Senior Status begins after discussions at parent-teacher interviews and upon a student’s return from Christmas Break. Grove Senior Status for students can be reviewed at any time thereafter and will be included in Grade 11 team meetings when appropriate. The Head of House may grant or revoke GSS at any time based upon the following criteria:

The purpose of disciplinary action is to help students become aware of the consequences of their behaviour and to deter them from misbehaviour. Disciplinary action is intended to deal fairly, compassionately and effectively with those violations which do occur, while protecting the welfare of all students and the integrity of the school as a whole.

                                    In serious situations, where the school’s values have been compromised, an Ad-Hoc Standards Committee convenes to review the specific details of the situation and to make recommendations for appropriate accountability. The committee comprises a combination of the following individuals:

                                    Information is gathered and recommendations are forwarded to the Head of School after discussions have ended. The Standards Committee is committed to due process, consistency and fairness for all students. Students are held accountable for their actions. While it is not always popular to do so, the Senior students must be diligent about maintaining expected standards. Attitudes of the Seniors toward discipline often reflect the effectiveness of the graduating class as a whole in the eyes of the other students and of the staff.

                                    The Standards process is designed to allow the student to gain an awareness of their behaviour and to take responsibility for their actions. For further information on the Standards process, please refer to page 57.

At no time are students to be in (swimming) or on the water (including the docks and all watercraft) without the permission of their Head of House and a qualified lifeguard must be present at all times when students are in or on the water.

                        As the waterfront is an important part of much of our school programming, all students are required to complete a swim test in order for the school to discern a student’s swimming ability and level.

                        Students are not permitted to go in or on the water at any place in the Village of Lakefield. It is illegal to smoke or vape in public parks. Students who are caught smoking/vaping, loitering or behaving inappropriately in these areas will be banned from visiting these areas for the remainder of the year on their first offence. Students may be required to attend a meeting of the Standards Committee for breaching Out of Bounds/Trespassing standards for subsequent offences.

                        Out of respect for our neighbours in the Lakefield community, students must not trespass on private property such as Tate Lane, Casement Lane, the woods behind Winfield Shores, or across the highway from the school. Any student trespassing in these or other private properties will receive three days gating. Subsequent offences will result in increased accountability including the possibility of a meeting of the Standards Committee.

                        Trespassing on Staff/Student Property
                        As stated in The Grove Commitment, trust and respect require that each student possess a caring attitude for fellow students and staff as well as for the school and its traditions.

                        Appreciating the rights and dignity of all of the people who are members of this community is an essential part of the growth of an LCS student.

                        A person’s right to privacy and safe possessions is fundamental to the values of our community. Therefore, students are not to enter the rooms or private spaces of the school, or other students or staff, without permission. Students who enter into another student’s room or any private space, including but not limited to journals, smart phones, diaries, etc. without permission is an invasion of privacy and will be considered to be trespassing.

                        Accountability: After meeting with their Head of House and the Assistant Head: School Life, a student may be required to attend a meeting of the Standards Committee for Trespassing.

                        Introduction
                        In order for Lakefield College School to fulfill its mission and to foster an environment that enables its students to develop to their full potential, the school, justifiably, takes an active interest in the overall well-being of its students.

                        Lakefield College School believes that student use of tobacco, tobacco like products, electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS) alcohol, cannabis or any other drugs, either on school property or at school events, seriously interferes with the health, academic and co-curricular interests of that student, other students and the community in general.

                        The school acknowledges that the use of these and other drugs is prevalent in today’s society and that students are most likely to experiment with them during their adolescent years, a great deal of which will be spent at school. LCS also recognizes the negative influence of drug and alcohol use on a student’s ability to achieve and to meet the objectives of the school, necessitating the school’s responsibility to provide clear policy statements and strategies for the school community.

                        With the creation of these policies and procedures for dealing with alcohol, tobacco, tobacco-like products, ENDS, cannabis and other drugs, the school wishes to establish and maintain a caring, supportive and disciplined approach, with the understanding that certain offences cannot be tolerated.

                            The school is committed to providing regular education and training faculty, Health and Well-being Centre staff, students and parents.

                            Students and parents will be fully informed at the beginning of the school year of the school’s policy and position on tobacco, tobacco like products, ENDS, alcohol, cannabis and other drugs. In addition, the school will work with our local Public Health Unit and O.P.P. Liaison Officer for support and to ensure the school has accurate up-to-date information. Students will be engaged in a comprehensive health and education program through curriculum and related activities at all levels of the school. The aims of this program are to:
                            i) increase student awareness;

                            ii) provide students with the tools needed to make educated and informed decisions; and

                            iii) encourage prevention through education.

                            One of the school’s primary responsibilities is to foster a community that allows for open and honest communication between all of its members. In order to do this the school embraces a “Parley Policy” which allows students to come forward voluntarily or to report their concern for another student who may need help. When a Parley is requested a student can rightly assume that no disciplinary measures will be invoked. The school, through the Health and Well-being Centre and other counselling support as required, will provide non-judgmental and unbiased support to the student in need. The Health and Well-being Centre staff will initiate an individualized support plan of action focusing specifically on the student’s immediate and long-term health needs. Services may include counselling within the school or referral to appropriate outside services. Intervention and counselling procedures may include the following:
                            i) intervention support strategies at the school level and local community level;

                            ii) short term counselling procedures; and

                            The following steps outline the Standards Committee process at Lakefield College School:
                            1. The student meets with the Assistant Head: School Life (in the presence of at least one other staff member or student) in order to learn about the process and to further clarify the situation. The Assistant Head: School Life will be entitled to ask questions of the student.
                            At this point in the process it is important to understand that the degree of honesty and forthrightness shown by the student(s) is taken into consideration in determining the accountability. The student may be held accountable for any deceit or dishonesty throughout the process.
                            2. During the meeting, the student may ask any question of the Assistant Head: School Life; this may help to clarify the student’s understanding of the severity of the situation. The meeting is intended to be a dialogue.
                            3. The student will be invited to refer to the School Life Guide in order to discern the potential accountability for his/her actions. At this point the student will be asked if he/she has any questions, concerns, or needs.
                            4. Prior to the adjournment of the meeting, the student will be reminded that he/she may seek support from the Health and Well-being Centre or counselling staff at any time.
                            5. The Assistant Head: School Life may convene a pre-standards inquiry with the, Co-Head Students and the Seniors-in-Charge of Standards.

                            Please note:
                            • In the event that a Standards Committee meeting is not necessary, accountability will be administered at the discretion of the Head of House and the Assistant Head: School Life;

                            • Expellable offences are dealt with by the Assistant Head: School Life, the Head of School, the student and his/her parents. The Standards Committee is not involved in deciding whether or not a student should be expelled from the school.

                            • In the event that a police investigation is required, the school will refrain from any internal investigation until such time as the police investigation is completed.

                            6. If a Standards meeting is required:
                            a. The Head of House will inform the student involved and will confirm the date, time and location of the Standards meeting,

                            b. The parents will be notified informing them of the violation and the date, time and location of the Standards meeting. Parents are welcome to be present on campus to support their son/daughter through the experience.

                            At all times throughout the Standards process the integrity and well-being of the student is taken into consideration. The student is invited and able to request counselling support at any time throughout the process. The school believes that a meeting of the Standards Committee is intended for the safety of each student and their education on core values. The school requests that each student be held accountable for his/her own actions in a manner which upholds the values of trust and respect for the community in which he/she lives and learns.

                                5. The student will be informed of their accountability and any other sanctions by the Assistant Head: School Life;

                                6. The Assistant Head: School Life will inform the parents, verbally and/or in writing, of the accountability and educational and support measures to be taken for the student(s) involved in the Standards Meeting;

                                9. All disciplinary action will be recorded in the student’s personal file and kept in the Head of School’s office. Expulsions are required to be recorded in the student’s Ontario Student Record (OSR) and may influence admission to university.
